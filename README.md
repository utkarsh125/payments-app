## Overview

Payments App is a robust, scalable, and modern solution designed for seamless financial transactions. Built with cutting-edge technologies, this application emphasizes security, scalability, and ease of integration with third-party systems.

---

## Architecture

The Payments App is architected as a modular, distributed system to ensure high scalability and maintainability. Below is a detailed description of the architecture:

### 1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
- **Framework**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **State Management**: Recoil is used for efficient and scalable state management.
- **UI**: Fully responsive design with custom components and minimal latency for user interactions.

### 2. **Backend (Node.js with Prisma)**
- **Framework**: A backend server built with Node.js to handle API routes and business logic.
- **ORM**: Prisma is used for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, ensuring type safety and ease of schema management.
- **Authentication**: Secure and token-based authentication for user sessions.

### 3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
- **Schema**: Relational database schema designed for financial transactions, user data, and audit logs.
- **Security**: Encrypted storage for sensitive data and role-based access control.
- **Scalability**: Optimized indexing and query planning for high performance.

### 4. **Containerization (Docker)**
- **Environment**: Docker is used for local development and deployment, ensuring consistent environments across systems.
- **Service Isolation**: Separate containers for the backend server, PostgreSQL, and additional services.

### 5. **Monorepo (TurboRepo)**
- **Structure**: The project follows a monorepo architecture using TurboRepo for managing multiple packages.
- **Code Sharing**: Common utilities and types are shared across the frontend and backend.

### 6. **Additional Features**
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Modular design to integrate various payment gateways like Stripe or Razorpay.
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed transaction logs for audit and compliance requirements.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error-handling middleware to ensure smooth user experience.
